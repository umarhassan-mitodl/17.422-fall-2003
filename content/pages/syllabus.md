Course Content
--------------

This field seminar in international political economy covers major theoretical, empirical, and policy perspectives. The basic orientation is disciplinary and comparative (over time and across countries, regions, firms), spanning issues relevant to both industrial and developing states. Special attention is given to challenges and dilemmas shaped by the macro-level consequences of micro-level behavior, and by micro-level adjustments to macro-level influences.

The first part of the course is on basic concepts and theoretical foundations, and covers assumptions and implications. The focus is on core economic principles and structural approaches, positive international political economy, and institutional approaches — leading to the articulation of complexity and introducing 'globalization' perspectives and contentions. The goal is to understand how theory is framed and 'works', the potential inferences and the contentions. The second part of the course draws on the theoretical foundations by 'using' concepts to examine a set of specific international exchanges, and related structures and processes. These include sources of 'demand', technology advances and the 'new' knowledge economy, trade and finance, firms and global markets. The third part converges on interactions of globalization and localization, political economy of the Internet and new e-markets and the fundamentals of 'sustainability' that question some of the core assumptions discussed in the first part of the course and 'utilized' in the second. The course concludes with analyses of select international institutional innovations.
